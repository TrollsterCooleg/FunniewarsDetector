Plugin to disallow Funniewars addicts from playing in a minecraft server with it installed.

If you wish to allow someone who has recently played in a Funniewars to bypass this, check the /funniewarsdetector command.

For Funniewars players who I believe can be trusted to be sane human beings, [I've created this global whitelist](https://github.com/TrollsterCooleg/FunniewarsDetectorWhitelist) which the plugin will automatically refresh every 5 minutes to allow normal people to still play. You can remove the code for this for yourself if you'd like, but since it's convenient for me and for people who can be trusted I am not going to remove it from my version.
